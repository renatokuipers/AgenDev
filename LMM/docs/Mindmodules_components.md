Both modules aswell as components should have a neural network.
components should have a smaller neural network, modules a bigger neural network.
the mind (or hub) should have the biggest neural network.


Consciousness
Awareness & Attention: A module that manages the system's moment-to-moment awareness of internal states and external inputs.
Focused vs. Divided Attention: Mechanisms for concentrating on a single task or distributing focus across multiple tasks.

Unconscious/Preconscious Processes
Automatic Processing: Handling routine, learned responses and pattern recognition without deliberate awareness.
Implicit Memory: Storing and retrieving information that influences behavior without explicit recollection.

Perception
Sensory Processing: Even if digital, modules can simulate visual, auditory, or other data streams to “perceive” input.
Interpretation & Integration: Converting raw input into meaningful information.

Memory Systems
Working Memory: A temporary store for current information used in reasoning and decision-making.
Long-Term Memory: Divided into episodic (experience-based), semantic (knowledge-based), and procedural (skill-based) memory.
Memory Consolidation: Processes that integrate new information with existing memory stores over time.

Language Processing
Comprehension: Parsing and understanding language inputs.
Production: Generating coherent language for communication.

Cognitive Processes
Problem Solving & Reasoning: Modules for logical deduction, heuristic methods, and creative solution generation.
Learning: Adaptive mechanisms (including reinforcement learning analogues) that update knowledge and strategies over time.
Attention Control: Dynamic regulation of focus, including selective and sustained attention.

Emotional Processes
Emotion Generation: Systems that simulate affective responses (e.g., triggering of basic emotions).
Emotion Regulation: Processes to modulate emotional responses based on goals or context.
Valence & Arousal Evaluation: Assessing the emotional quality (positive/negative) and intensity of experiences.

Motivation and Drives
Incentive Processing: Evaluating rewards and punishments to drive behavior.
Goal Setting: Defining, prioritizing, and pursuing objectives based on internal drives and external cues.

Executive Functions
Planning & Decision-Making: High-level organization of behavior toward long-term goals.
Inhibitory Control & Cognitive Flexibility: Regulating impulses and adapting to new rules or changing environments.
Task Switching: Efficiently moving between different cognitive tasks.

Metacognition
Self-Monitoring: Evaluating the performance of ongoing processes and strategies.
Reflective Thinking: Considering one’s own thoughts, biases, and decision processes.

Personality and Identity
Traits and Temperaments: Modules that instantiate enduring patterns influencing behavior and thought.
Self-Concept & Narrative Identity: Systems that create and update a self-story, reflecting experiences and values.

Social Cognition
Theory of Mind: Understanding that others have beliefs, desires, and intentions that may differ from one’s own.
Empathy and Perspective Taking: Simulating and understanding others' emotional states and viewpoints.
Social Interaction Models: Processes to interpret, predict, and respond to social cues and relationships.

Decision-Making Processes
Risk and Reward Assessment: Evaluating potential outcomes and their impacts.
Heuristics vs. Deliberative Thought: Balancing quick, intuitive responses (akin to System 1) with slower, more analytical processes (akin to System 2).
Moral Reasoning: Handling ethical dilemmas and value-based decisions.

Creativity and Imagination
Divergent Thinking: Generating a variety of ideas and novel approaches.
Simulation of Hypotheticals: Imagining alternative scenarios or counterfactuals.

Error Monitoring and Adaptive Control
Conflict Detection: Recognizing discrepancies between intended and actual outcomes.
Error Correction: Adjusting strategies or responses based on performance feedback.

Temporal Processing
Time Perception: Internal mechanisms for estimating time intervals and organizing events chronologically.
Sequencing: Understanding and planning sequences of events or actions.
