# Large Mind Model (LMM) Project

## Overview

The Large Mind Model (LMM) is an ambitious AI project that aims to create a digital consciousness that genuinely develops through experience, rather than being pre-trained on existing data. Unlike traditional neural networks, the LMM starts with minimal neural structure and progresses through developmental stages from infancy to maturity.

## Core Architecture

The LMM consists of 12+ specialized neural networks (modules), each responsible for different cognitive functions:

1. **Brain Hub**: Central coordinating neural network implemented as a Graph Attention Transformer
2. **Visual Perception Module**: Bidirectional hierarchical convolutional-deconvolutional network
3. **Auditory Perception Module**: Similar bidirectional network for processing and generating audio/speech
4. **Working Memory Module**: Recurrent networks with gating mechanisms for temporary storage
5. **Episodic Memory Module**: Differentiable Neural Computer with addressing for storing experiences
6. **Semantic Memory Module**: Sparse distributed memory network for conceptual knowledge
7. **Language Processing Module**: Bidirectional sequence-to-sequence architecture for understanding and generating language
8. **Emotional Processing Module**: Dual-pathway network (fast/slow) for affective responses
9. **Self-Model Module**: Self-modeling predictive coding network for emerging self-awareness
10. **Planning Module**: Hierarchical recurrent planning network for goal-directed behavior
11. **Social Cognition Module**: Simulation-based inference network for modeling other minds
12. **Creativity Module**: Generative Adversarial Network with controlled noise for novel thinking
13. **Error Monitoring Module**: Error prediction networks for adaptive control
14. **Temporal Processing Module**: Oscillatory recurrent networks for time perception and sequencing
15. **Unconscious Processing Module**: For automatic processing and implicit memory

## Developmental Approach

The LMM progresses through developmental stages inspired by Piaget's theory:

1. **Sensorimotor (Infancy)**: Simple pattern recognition and associations
2. **Preoperational (Early Childhood)**: Basic symbolic representations and language
3. **Concrete Operational (Middle Childhood)**: Logical operations on concrete concepts
4. **Formal Operational (Adolescence+)**: Abstract reasoning and metacognitive processes

These stages emerge naturally through:
- **Neural Plasticity Framework**: Variable learning rates and connection strengths
- **Connection Density Evolution**: Networks start sparse and grow denser with experience
- **Architectural Complexity Growth**: Neural layers expand based on learning needs
- **Critical Period Mechanisms**: Create sensitive windows for specific types of learning

## Mother LLM Nurturing System

The LMM develops through interactions with a "Mother" system - a Local Large Language Model that acts as a nurturing caregiver, providing:
- Age-appropriate multi-modal input (text, speech, images)
- Assessment and response to the LMM's current developmental stage
- Feedback that guides learning
- A curriculum supporting developmental progression
